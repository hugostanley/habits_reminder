# Habits Reminder for Linux

### A simple notification app reminder written in Ruby. Goal is for you to be notified about a specific reminder at a specific time given.

------------

## How this works
You provide a JSON file containing an array of "hours" and "reminders" that you'd want to be displayed on your machine.

------------

## TODOs:

- process optimization, can use a different thread for the loop
- different logic for the loop, especially the sleep interval
